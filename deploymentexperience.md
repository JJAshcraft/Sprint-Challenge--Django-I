## Favicon problems/Static Files

As I first step through this, I am struggling with static files. I keep getting errors related to the favicons, and I'm not sure why.

* Added static_root, and collected static files for deployment. 

I figured out that I needed somewhere to collect the static files, and added that to settings.py. I'm not following the postgres instructions too well at this point...I'm not too sure how to change the db over to postgres, none of the tutorials make sense in relation to this project at this point.
